This is a bot that scrapes scores from scoreboard.uscyberpatriot.org. It takes the scores, creates an embed, and then sends the text in chat. Unfortunately, it requires a key to run, and along with the scoreboard frequently being down, it can't be used at the moment.
eg. "-team 14-1492" would return the image "AFA BOT IMAGE.png"
